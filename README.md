# IPL-MATCH-WINNER-PREDICTOR

IPL dataset is taken to analyze the metrics of different teams in IPL.
Libraries such as  numpy,pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are used to perform exploratory data analysis on top of this IPL data.
Records of the past performance of players and other related data          
          can be analysed to create models that predicts the winning team.
 
 
Finally, some machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict which team has a better likelihood of winning the tournament. 
 Based on some match stats, we’re predicting who is the winner of an IPL match.
 
 Through this project, the exploratory data analysis and feature engineering techniques that need to be applied to process data.
